						<div class="content">
							<p>Since young I've always had a passion for video games. Out of everything that I had experienced they were special to me. Years later, I've followed that passion and it led me to studying Games and Multimedia at Polytechnic of Leiria. Over the past few years, I've worked on various projects and learned an abundance of skills as a Game Designer while also developing a strong intrest in Creative Writing and Narrative Design.</p>

							<p>My main role at Grupo Infinito Particular during the internship was video editing and creation for Instagram. This role saw me using Adobe After Effects and Adobe Premiere Pro to create a total of 30 animations and videos on several different titles. I had a wide array of responsibilities and creative freedom being in charge of the whole creation process, from brainstorming all the way to presentation and formatting of the post. </p>

							<p>In Cataway, you play as the owner of this sneaky black cat. You came home after a long long day and just want to relax. However your cat had other plans, he ran away and made a mess of his path through forests and such. You must push and break rocks to get to him and return him home so you can finally relax.</p>
							</ul>
							<p>This was the first project I worked on. It was developed by 2 people on GBStudio. It was small  but served as a good basis for future works.</p>

							<p>In a universe where an endangered species is close to its extinction Lisa gets involved in the action. She saw an opportunity to go on an adventure: some unknown scientists were looking for volunteers to run tests and training in order to save endangered species of lizards, mixing both human and reptile DNA. Not sketchy at all!  Lisa, feeling bad for the poor lizards, decides to contact them. As the upbeat person she is, the doctors nickname her Lyzzy and is flown to the lizard's habitat and starts trying to help them</p>

						<p>Dina is the young heiress of the Ganlir's kingdom throne. However she has no desire to inherit it. There is only one thing this 11 year old princess wants: To explore the world with her own two feet. However her father, Alder Ganlir, doesn't allow her to leave the palace and locks Dina in her room at night. However, one night a fairy visited her room and gifted her a magic stone that allows her to teleport to it! Now that Dina has the power to escape she will have to stealth through the patrolling guards and solving puzzles to open doors. But there are many ways to exit the palace, which one will she choose?</p>
							</ul>
							<p>The overall scope of this project was large and required multiple abilities which I wasn't experienced in. The non-linear nature of the game made me have to learn new ways of design the Level. The multiple exits and different paths that could be taken by the player proved to be an interesting challenge to design balanced missions. It also allowed me to better hone my communication and leadership skills as well as learning how to do efficient research, in regards to the castle rooms and objet dimensions.</p>

						<h3>Unrealeased Game Reviews</h3>

						<div class="content">
						<p>You are walking the streets of Victorian England, on your way back from work. The run-down building you pass every day has finally been renovated and the sign outside reads “Hildred’s Tavern”. Feeling tired from a hard day’s work, you decide to go in and are met by a friendly barkeep who gladly serves you a hot meat pie and a refreshing ale. As you leave, you notice the sign for the shop above the tavern, “Percival’s Tailor Shop”. You could use a new suit, so you decide to make a visit. The tailor greets you and leads you into the back room. As he sizes you up, he thrusts his knife in your neck. The last words you hear are “You’ll make a nice pie.” </p>
						<p>This is the reality that the Hither Blue Lake’s citizens face in Ravenous Devils. In this flavourful Sweeney Todd inspired game which is Bad Vice Studios third and newest project, you play as Hildred and Percival, a murderous couple who are on the run after being chased out of their previous town. They’ve set-up their tavern in an abandoned building, which used to be a barber shop. Now, it’s your job to make the business thrive with the help of a secret Ingredient: Crime! A little murder never hurt anyone, if we ignore the people being killed. You can use the meat for the pies and fix up their clothes to sell. A resourceful business is a profitable one.</p>

							<p>The station was quiet. The mechanical sound of keyboards and the loud vibrations of a coffee machine were the only sounds I could hear. The sluggish morning air permeated the unfamiliar building. It was like any other day… Or at least it should’ve been.</p>
							<p>In between the usual early day sighs and yawns, I could feel the officers’ unease. Everyone moved with a bit more urgency, their eyes sunken, probably due to the lack of sleep. They are all on edge and I was no different...</p>
